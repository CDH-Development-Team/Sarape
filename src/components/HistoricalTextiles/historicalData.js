    description: "By the 1900s, many weavers in Mexico and New Mexico had developed styles unique to their regions or workshops. Regional weaving centers were established in the cities of Saltillo, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Texcoco, San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, and, of course, Teotitl√°n del Valle in Oaxaca, among others. The textiles were woven on treadle looms using both natural and synthetic-dyed yarn.",
    description2: "Oaxacan sarapes of the late 1800s and early 1900s feature either a central diamond or a circular center design. They have patterned and plain backgrounds, as well as borders. Banded stripes are often woven along the ends. Oaxacan sarapes usually have warps and wefts made of wool. In comparison, sarapes woven in other areas of Mexico usually have warp threads of finely spun cotton that are completely covered by tightly packed woolen weft threads. ",
