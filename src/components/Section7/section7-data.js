    "Looms used by Indigenous communities in northwest Mexico and the southwestern United States are different from those used by weavers elsewhere to produce sarapes. Instead of backstrap or treadle looms, they use horizontal looms made of hand-hewn logs. The weavings of the Rarámuri (Tarahumara) Indians in Chihuahua, and Mayo Indians in Sonora and Sinaloa, show the influence of Saltillo sarape designs.",

Using horizontal looms made of large logs, they weave thick, woolen blankets of loosely hand-spun yarn. The looms have warps (the vertical threads) consisting of one continuous piece of yarn that loops around a log at each end.",
  description2:
    "Designs are simple, and often include Saltillo sarape diamonds in different configurations. Saltillo sarape design elements have been used since at least the late 1800s. The Saltillo influence may have traveled up the Camino Real, the famed trade route between Mexico City and Santa Fe, which ran through parts of Rarámuri traditional territory in eastern Chihuahua. Spanish missions were established among the Rarámuri beginning in the early 1600s, so despite their remote location, they were not cut off from outside influences.",

Nevertheless, Mayos still maintain distinct religious practices along with their own language and craft traditions. Several villages are known for their blanket-weaving expertise.",
  description2:
    "Mayo weavers are almost exclusively women. They use horizontal looms to produce two broad categories of blankets: plain-banded cobijas, which are mainly woven for the community’s use, and more decorative sarapes, which are primarily woven for trade. In Sinaloa’s Mayo community, a small number of men weave simple blankets on treadle looms.",
  description3:
    "Since at least the late 1800s, Mayo weavers have woven their own version of sarapes with designs clearly connected to Saltillo. These would have been popular items to trade with Mexican residents of the region, including those in the nearby colonial town of Alamos. In the 1940s, this formerly wealthy mining community attracted additional potential craft customers when American tourists “discovered” its charm and created an expatriate community there.",

    "Early settlers to the far northern reaches of New Spain, in what is now New Mexico, brought along the treadle loom and Churro sheep. By the 1630s, European-style treadle looms were made locally and Spanish-style obrajes (workshops) were established. New Mexican weavers adopted the Saltillo design system but enlarged the pattern and initially rendered it less finely.",
  description2:
    "In addition, Spanish and Indian populations were required to make repartimientos (payments) to the Spanish landholders, and textiles were in high demand for this purpose. To ensure the production of textiles, the Spanish government hired skilled artisans from Puebla, Mexico to teach weaving. Master weavers Juan and Ygnacio Bazán, who came to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1807, are credited with the introduction of more-complex textile weaving.",

Tapestry textiles use finer yarns and more warp thread per inch, tend to be more intricate in design, and are usually displayed like artworks on a wall.

    "According to traditional stories, Spider Woman wove the universe and then taught the Navajo people to weave in order to achieve hózhó— balance, harmony, beauty, and order. Early Navajo weaving was similar in many ways to that of the nearby Pueblo Indians. They both used upright looms and had been introduced to sheep’s wool and dyes through contact with Spaniards and Mexicans.",
  description2:
    "In the mid-1800s, Navajo weavings begin to show influences from Mexican sarapes, including a longer-than-wide orientation and inclusion of serrate-edged diamonds and vertical zigzags. Textiles from this period also feature stepped and terraced motifs, reflective of early Navajo basketry but also similar to Saltillo design elements. Navajo weavers may have seen Mexican and New Mexican Saltillo- style weavings while imprisoned at Bosque Redondo, in New Mexico, from 1864 to 1868, or even via trading. During that period, Navajo women were encouraged to weave and were supplied with dyed yarns from Germantown, Pennsylvania. Saltillo design elements are still used by Navajo weavers today.",
