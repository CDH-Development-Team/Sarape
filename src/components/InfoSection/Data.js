    description2: "For thousands of years, Indigenous people of the Americas have woven textiles on backstrap looms using local materials, including cotton, other plant fibers, and animal hair. In Mexico, as in other parts of the Americas, weaving practices were further shaped by Spanish colonization, which introduced sheep and the treadle loom. The distinctive Saltillo sarape design developed out of this early colonial period. Today, Indigenous and Hispanic weavers in Mexico and the southwestern United States continue to interpret the Saltillo sarape’s designs.",

    description: "The Mexican nationalist movement of the early 1900s, appropriated the country’s Spanish and Indigenous identities to create a hybrid “Mexican” identity. The Saltillo sarape turned out to be one of the country’s most enduring symbols. This period saw the rise of the rainbow-striped blanket, which became synonymous with Mexico through its use in films, posters, and advertising. ",
    description2:"As tourism to Mexico increased, many visitors purchased these colorful sarapes as souvenirs. With demand on the rise, sarape-manufacturing plants were established. Through the use of electric-powered looms, synthetic dyes, and acrylic yarns, production time was shortened and the number of textiles increased. As a result, by the 1930s, there was a drastic decline in handwoven sarapes and the use of natural-dyed yarns.",
