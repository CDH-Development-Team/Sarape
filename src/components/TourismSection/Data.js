    description: "The Mexican nationalist movement of the early 1900s, appropriated the country’s Spanish and Indigenous identities to create a hybrid “Mexican” identity. The Saltillo sarape turned out to be one of the country’s most enduring symbols. This period saw the rise of the rainbow-striped blanket, which became synonymous with Mexico through its use in films, posters, and advertising. ",
    description2:"As tourism to Mexico increased, many visitors purchased these colorful sarapes as souvenirs. With demand on the rise, sarape-manufacturing plants were established. Through the use of electric-powered looms, synthetic dyes, and acrylic yarns, production time was shortened and the number of textiles increased. As a result, by the 1930s, there was a drastic decline in handwoven sarapes and the use of natural-dyed yarns.",
